# About this document

This document provides more details about how to configure and manage the network interfaces for the virtual appliance.

# Important Notes
* LEO designed the virtual appliance to function with two interfaces: one for monitoring traffic (the "promiscuous" interface)
  and one for controlling the appliance (the "management" interface)
* Having two interfaces it not necessary, but it is recommended
