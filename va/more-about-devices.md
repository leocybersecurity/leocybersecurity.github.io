# About this document

This document provides more details about how to configure and manage the network interfaces for the virtual appliance.

# Important Notes
* Once the management interface is configured, we recommend using a secure shell client to cut and paste the device name and
  license key into the interface. 

# Common Problems
* **I can't paste into the interface!**  Some SSH clients change the way they paste into restricted shells.  Hold down the 
  `shift` key to override this behavior.
* **Applying the changes failed!**  Please make certain you have configured the virtual appliance for Internet access over 
  the management interface.
