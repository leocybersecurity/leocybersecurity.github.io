# About this document
This document describes the features available for the LEO Virtual Appliance version 1.0 product.

# IDS
This is a standard intrusion detection framework that utilizes standard and custom rules to identify normal, abnormal, and malicious network traffic. We use the IDS to add context to network telemetry and to supplement the telemetry we receive directly from end-point agents.

# Flow Monitoring
Flow monitoring records all network connections meta-data. E.g. source and destination IP and ports, port independent protocol identification, amount of data sent and received, TCP and UDP specific data, and more. This is used to analyze end point and application behavior.

# HTTPS fingerprinting
The meta-data of encrypted communications can be used to infer what clients generated that encrypted traffic.

# File fingerprinting
The meta-data of files sent over the monitored network unencrypted can be used to identify malicious, unwanted, and other files and their types.
